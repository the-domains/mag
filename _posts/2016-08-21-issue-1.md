Can a wooden chair swing sideways? When Boris Bandyopadhyay (read "Bondopadye"), a German-Indian furniture and interior designer, came up with this question a couple years ago, he could not imagine that one day he would revolutionise our notion of sitting. Together with the Sicilian architect Fabio Schillaci he designed [SCR 01][0] -- the world's first side-swinging chair. The idea is astonishingly simple, the implementation radically elegant. One could easily put SCR 01 next to the Eames chair. But the best way to experience Indi is with your own bottom. The subtle side-swinging -- an unexperienced sitting movement so far -- feels so good that it is hard to get up again. How crazy is that?!

**How do you organise your thoughts?**  
I scribble words on a big sheet of paper and try to build some clusters in order to get things straight. It doesn't work in my head only.

**Which line should we rather avoid to follow?**  
The one that lies too straight in front of us.

**With whom would you like to share a notebook?**  
With my six-year old son. It's already happening. Last time he asked me to draw patterns with him. And then, each of us was alternately drawing a row. I really enjoyed that.

**What was the last thing that thwarted your plans?**  
I have the impression that my plans are thwarted every day -- if I had something like a plan. Let me put it this way, I always work on a plan just to have something to thwart.

**Do you believe in love at second sight?**  
I believe in love. No matter at what sight.

**What can never be found between the lines?**  
What other people think. Between the lines we always only find ourselves.

**Do you have a handwritten note that you have kept for years?**  
I have piles of handwritten copies of text messages from six years ago. I even developed a specific format to archive them!

**What is your favourite writing tool?**  
A scratchy pen. It gives me the feeling that I'm carving the paper but it puts enough ink on the sheet to leave the paper intact. That's amazing. It makes this khrrr-khrrr noise and at the end you see words not furrows.

**Do you like drawing while explaining something?**  
I would love to do that but I'm afraid my drawings aren't good enough. They tend to confuse people.

**Which object on your desk could you not live without?**  
The computer. Quite ordinary.

**Do you write letters? To whom?**  
Of course I do! To my son, to my girlfriend, to my mother, to my friends, ... Well, that sounds as if I wrote many letters. But yes, from time to time I like to write.

**What is your favorite spice?**  
I would say the Indian long pepper. But it's quite resistant, almost impossible to grind and very hot.

**Do you have a palm stone?**  
Probably my iPhone 3, which I still haven't trashed. But it has pleasantly rounded edges and it slides so smoothly into my pocket.

**Can you name one design classic that is totally overrated?**  
I would say the squeezer from Philippe Starck. Although I admire him and he made some really fantastic things -- for example the plastic chair Louis Ghost for Kartell. But you really could go without Juicy Salif.

**What is your latest discovery?**  
If you cut a sheet of steel with a certain pattern, it will become soft as butter without being destroyed.

**Which object you designed should we know?**  
All! (Laugh. Editor's note.) But if I had to pick one I would say SCR 01\. It's the first chair that can swing sideways. Simple and impressive.

**What is the most frequent mistake in furnishing?**  
Sometimes it's not that easy to imagine how a single object will look like in the own apartment. The light, the sound and the daily use can make a piece of furniture appear fundamentally different from the showroom.

**Which interior would you like to show us?**  
A bathroom in Marseille. I can't really tell (you) what's so fascinating about that interior but I keep dreaming about it. It's all black, the light comes from the top and it houses a big old branch.
